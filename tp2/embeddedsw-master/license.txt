 *
 * Please coordinate changes and requests with Leon Woestenberg

 *
 * Integration with your code:
 *
 * In lwip/dhcp.h
 * #define DHCP_COARSE_TIMER_SECS (recommended 60 which is a minute)
 * #define DHCP_FINE_TIMER_MSECS (recommended 500 which equals TCP coarse timer)
 *
 * Then have your application call dhcp_coarse_tmr() and
 * dhcp_fine_tmr() on the defined intervals.
 *
 * dhcp_start(struct netif *netif);
 * starts a DHCP client instance which configures the interface by
 * obtaining an IP address lease and maintaining it.
 *
 * Use dhcp_release(netif) to end the lease and use dhcp_stop(netif)
 * to remove the DHCP client.
