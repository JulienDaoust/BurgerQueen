This file implements the Intel CFI Version of the XFlash Library.<p>
<dl compact><dt><b>Note:</b></dt><dd></dd></dl>
<ul>
<li>Special consideration has to be given to varying data bus widths. To boost performance, multiple devices in parallel on the data bus are accessed in parallel. Therefore to reduce complexity and increase performance, many local primitive functions are duplicated with the only difference being the width of writes to the devices. <br>
<br>
 Even with the performance boosting optimizations, the overhead associated is rather high due to the general purpose nature of its design. <br>
<br>
 Flash block erasing is a time consuming operation with nearly all latency occurring due to the devices' themselves. It takes on the order of 1 second to erase each block. <br>
<br>
 Writes by comparison are much quicker so library overhead becomes an issue. The write algorithm has been optimized for bulk data programming and should provide relatively better performance.</li><li>The code/comments refers to WSM frequently. This stands for Write State Machine. WSM is the internal programming engine of the devices.</li><li>This library and the underlying Intel flash memory does not allow re- programming while code is executing from the same memory.</li><li>If hardware is flakey or fails, then this library could hang a thread of execution.</li></ul>
