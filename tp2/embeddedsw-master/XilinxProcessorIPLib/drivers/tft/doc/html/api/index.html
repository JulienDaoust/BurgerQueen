<h1>tft v5_0</h1>
<p>
This header file contains the definitions and declarations for the high level driver to access the Xilinx TFT Controller Device.<p>
The device has the capability of displaying data onto a 640*480 VGA TFT screen. It can take up to 256K colors. There is no interrupt mode.<p>
The functions XTft_Setpixel and XTft_Getpixel are provided in the driver to write to and read from the individual pixels, the color values.<p>
These are generally stored in the assigned 2MB Video Memory which is configurable.<p>
Video Memory stores each pixel value in 32bits. Out of this 2MB memory which can hold 1024 pixels per line and 512 lines per frame data, only 640 pixels per line and 480 lines per frame are used.<p>
Each base color Red, Green, Blue is encoded using 6 bits which sums up to 18bits which is stored in the Dual port BRAM.<p>
<b>Initialization &amp; Configuration</b><p>
The <a class="el" href="struct_x_tft___config.html">XTft_Config</a> structure is used by the driver to configure itself. This configuration structure is typically created by the tool-chain based on HW build properties.<p>
To support multiple runtime loading and initialization strategies employed by various operating systems, the driver instance can be initialized as follows:<p>
<ul>
<li>XTft_CfgInitialize(InstancePtr, CfgPtr, BaseAddress) - Uses a configuration structure provided by the caller. If running in a system with address translation, the provided virtual memory base address replaces the physical address present in the configuration structure.</li></ul>
<p>
<b>Interrupts</b><p>
The TFT device supports a single interrupt which is generated for a Vsync pulse.<p>
This driver does not provide a Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for the device. It is the responsibility of the application to provide one if needed.<p>
<b>RTOS Independence</b><p>
This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent. It works with physical addresses only. Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must be satisfied by the layer above this driver.<p>
